The MIT Spring Open was held on March 30, 2013, drawing over 70 players from the greater Boston area. 

In the Open Singles, fellow club-mates of the Boston Table Tennis Club Michael Wang and Vladimir Shapiro battled it out for the champion. Michael Wang came back from a 0-2 deficit to clinch the title.

Another star of the tournament, David Cui, just X years old, clinched the U2100 title and came in 2nd for U1900. He is surely a rising star to watch out for.

The organizing committee would like to thank all sponsors and contestants who made the event a success!
